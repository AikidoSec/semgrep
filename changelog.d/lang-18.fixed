Fixed how the end positions assigned to metavariable bindings are computed to
handle trailing newlines. This affected Semgrep's JSON output. If a metafariable
`$X` was bound to a piece of text containing a trailing newline, such as "a\n",
where the starting position was at line 1, Semgrep reported that the end position
was at line 2, when it fact the text is entirely within line 1. If the text
happened to be at the end of a file, Semgrep could report an end position that
was outside the bounds of the file.
