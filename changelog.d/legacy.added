New --legacy flag to force the use of the old Python implementation of
Semgrep (also known as 'pysemgrep'). Note that by default most semgrep
commands are still using the Python implementation (except 'semgrep
interactive'), so in practice you don't need to add this flag, but as
we port more commands to OCaml, the new --legacy flag might be useful
if you find some regressions.
