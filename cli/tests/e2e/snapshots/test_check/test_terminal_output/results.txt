METRICS: Using configs from the Registry (like --config=p/ci) reports pseudonymous rule metrics to semgrep.dev.
To disable Registry rule metrics, use "--metrics=off".
Using configs only from local files (like --config=xyz.yml) does not enable metrics.

More information: https://semgrep.dev/docs/metrics


Scanning across multiple languages:
    python | 3 rules Ã— 11 files
        js | 1 rule  Ã—  3 files


Some files were skipped or only partially analyzed.
  Scan was limited to files tracked by git.

Ran 4 rules on 14 files: 2 findings.
