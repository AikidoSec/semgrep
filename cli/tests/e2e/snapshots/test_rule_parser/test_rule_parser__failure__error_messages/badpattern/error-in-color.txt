	This can happen because it overflowed the stack or used too much memory.
	Try changing the stack limit with `ulimit -s <limit>` or adding
	`--max-memory <memory>` to the semgrep command. For CI runs with interfile
	analysis, the default max-memory is 5000MB. Depending on the memory
	available in your runner, you may need to lower it. We recommend choosing
	a limit 70% of the available memory to allow for some overhead. If you have
	tried these steps and still are seeing this error, please contact us.
