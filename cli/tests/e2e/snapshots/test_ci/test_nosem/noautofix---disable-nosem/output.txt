Fetching configuration from semgrep.dev
Fetching rules from https://semgrep.dev/registry.

Rules downloaded from https://semgrep.dev/p/something failed to parse.
This is likely because rules have been added that use functionality introduced in later versions of semgrep.
Please upgrade to latest version of semgrep (see https://semgrep.dev/docs/upgrading/) and try again.
