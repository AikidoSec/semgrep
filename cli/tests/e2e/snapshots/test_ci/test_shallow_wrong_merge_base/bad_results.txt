Rules downloaded from https://semgrep.dev/api/agent/scans/<MagicMock name='post().json().__getitem__().__getitem__()' id='140372763727184'>/rules.yaml failed to parse.
This is likely because rules have been added that use functionality introduced in later versions of semgrep.
Please upgrade to latest version of semgrep (see https://semgrep.dev/docs/upgrading/) and try again.
