METRICS: Using configs from the Registry (like --config=p/ci) reports pseudonymous rule metrics to semgrep.dev.
To disable Registry rule metrics, use "--metrics=off".
Using configs only from local files (like --config=xyz.yml) does not enable metrics.

More information: https://semgrep.dev/docs/metrics

Semgrep rule registry URL is https://semgrep.dev/registry.
