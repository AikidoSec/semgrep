  message: |
    We do not want a match here. This rule is looking for `foo` being called on an identifier
    which does not start with `_`, which clearly `_y` does.
    Unfortunately, because of our matching logic, we decide to produce a match to both the
    identifier, and the resolved name. So we flag this, even though in intention it isn't
    faithful.
